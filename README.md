## Environment Installation Guide (PyTorch + TensorFlow)

Below are the detailed steps to set up a development environment with the correct versions of PyTorch, TensorFlow, and other essential data science libraries, ensuring CUDA compatibility.

---

#### **Step 1: Install PyTorch (with the correct command)**

First, install PyTorch, torchvision, and torchaudio using the official command that points to the binaries compiled for CUDA 12.1. This is compatible with a system that has CUDA 12.1 installed, as the important thing is the NVIDIA driver version.

Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

#### **Step 2: Create and use the `requirements.txt` file**

Now, create a file named `requirements.txt` with the following content. This file includes TensorFlow 2.15 (which is compatible with CUDA 12.1 and cuDNN 8.9) and the other data science libraries.

```plaintext
# requirements.txt

# TensorFlow compatible with CUDA 12.1 and cuDNN 8.9
tensorflow==2.15.0

# Standard Machine Learning and visualization libraries
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
pandas
numpy
```

#### **Step 3: Install the remaining dependencies**

With the `requirements.txt` file in the folder, run the following command in your terminal to install the rest of the libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **Step 4: Connect your environment to Jupyter (Optional)**

To use this environment within Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, you need to install `ipykernel` and register it.

1.  **Install ipykernel**:
    Inside your active environment, install the `ipykernel` package. This allows Jupyter to communicate with your environment's Python interpreter.
    ```bash
    # If you are using conda
    conda install ipykernel
    # Or if you are using pip/venv
    pip install ipykernel
    ```

2.  **Register the kernel with Jupyter**:
    Now, you need to register this environment as a new kernel. Replace `your_env_name` with the actual name of your environment.
    ```bash
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=your_env_name --display-name="Python (your_env_name)"
    ```
    -   `--name=your_env_name`: This is the internal name Jupyter will use.
    -   `--display-name="Python (your_env_name)"`: This is the name you will see in Jupyter's kernel menu.

#### **Process Summary**

> 1.  **Install PyTorch** with the command from Step 1.
> 2.  **Create the `requirements.txt` file** with the content from Step 2.
> 3.  **Install the rest of the libraries** with the command from Step 3.
> 4.  **Connect to Jupyter** by installing and registering `ipykernel` as shown in Step 4.

By following these steps, you will have an environment with all the requested libraries, configured to use your GPU and ready to be used in Jupyter. âœ…
